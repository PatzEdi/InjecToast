This is the documentation for InjecToast, created by PatzEdi.

In order to use this tool, you should read all of this documentation. Overall, it is really easy to use.

So, let's start.

The first things you should have are:
An android application decompilation tool such as: ApkTool, or, if you are on an Android device, ApkToolM might make things easier.

Once you have those, you can start the process. The links to these tools are in the README.

You are now ready to start decompiling. 

Decompile your apk with apktool or ApktoolM. This will give you a folder containing all of the application's contents. Copy the directory of the decompiled app.

At this point, go into your terminal emulator. If you are on an Android device, you can use Termux, also linked in the README.

Make sure you have installed InjecToast via pip, instructions are on README. 

Once InjecToast is installed, run the command: InjecToast

This command you will run in the terminal, and once you run it will give you the help or arguments InjecToast accepts. 

Once you are ready to proceed, you can execute with:

InjecToast -t "Your toast message" -d /Path/To/DecompiledApp/

When you execute it, please, MAKE SURE you have your toast message in quotation marks, otherwise, an error will occur.

If you have done everything correctly, a log will start. It will show you what is happening, all in real time. Sometimes, the process can take longer than usual.


Now, lets talk about dealing with errors.

Sometimes, the toast Injector will lead to the application having problems. Unfortunately, not much can be done. It works for around 95 percent of applications tested. 

If the toast injector leads to compilation errors, try it on another application.

Thanks again!
